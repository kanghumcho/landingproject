## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development | Formatting the Nav Bar

Most of the changes in the project happened in the `js/app.js` file and some changes for styling in `styles.css`.
I added section four in the `index.html` file to meet the project requirement.

The Javascript contains the necessary requirements for the project.
The navigationg bar is built by utilizing js
I used css to center the navigation bar so it has a horizontal look.
By utilizing the `.isIntersecting` property, I tried to add the active class. It took me many
hours to try to figure out how this works (still not sure if it does work).
Moreover, it has the event listener `.scrollIntoView` to let it scroll down the page to the selected section in a smooth manner.

## Struggles | What I still struggle with

As mentioned in the Development section, I am not sure if what I did is correct (I am not even sure if I understood completely).
I did not really understand what building a menu was so I just tried to meet the rubric requirements.
